# Mini Rust Projects Compilation

Welcome to my collection of mini projects built with Rust!  
This program is a collection of three small projects that I developed to practice the Rust fundamentals.  
It can run directly from the terminal on any machine.  

The following projects were created as part of my journey while learning Rust, based on fundamental concepts I learned from the *Rust Book*.

## List of the projects

This terminal-based program provides a menu of the following projects to choose from:

### 1) Temperature Converter
A program that allows you to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit (or vice versa).

### 2) Fibonacci Sequence Generator
A program that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using Binet's formula.

### 3) Christmas Carol Generator
A program that prints the lyrics of the carol *The Twelve Days of Christmas*, using `while` loops to automatically generate the repeated parts of the song.

## How to run the program?

You can simply download the release files from the "Releases" section and double-click on them to open them.  
  
Note that on Linux, you may need to run the file directly from the terminal.  
This program has been optimized for macOS and Linux and might work slightly differently on Windows. 

## How to build this program?

If you prefer to compile the program yourself, you can:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Build and run the project using `cargo run`.

Note that this requires having Rust installed on your computer.
